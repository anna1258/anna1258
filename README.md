## About Me
<p style="font-size:20px;">
● &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I graduated in 2017 and entered the security industry. I found that I have a strong desire to share, but I was too lazy to record it, which led to forgetting a lot of things after reading them. Now I have decided to write them down and share with everyone.
 <br>● &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am most familiar with the Java language, and I enjoy code auditing and SDL construction the most, followed by black box penetration testing.
 <br>● &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work experience: During the rise of network security, I built a 20-person security service team in a security company, and later transferred to a certain terminal manufacturer as the first party.
 <br>● &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My original intention: I am very sure that I like the security industry and want to do valuable things that are helpful to the industry, the company, and individuals. However, I have been exploring how to do it and what to do specifically.
